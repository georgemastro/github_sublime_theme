This is a GitHub theme for Sublime Text 2.

The basic colors are defined, but I'm sure it can be improved (Improved indeed by Mastro!).

To use, copy it to ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes/

Or simply run:
`$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes && curl -O https://raw.github.com/sbecker/github_textmate_theme/master/GitHub.tmTheme`
